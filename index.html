            The Dunmer have learned over the ages to live in harmony 
            with the inhospitable landscape of Morrowind, which is 
            largely unsuited to agriculture. The dark volcanic terrain 
            makes farming and hunting difficult. They gather kwama eggs, 
            cultivate crops of ash yams, and maintain herds of 
            domesticated guar, from which they harvest meat and hides. A 
            wide variety of drinks also feature in Dunmer cuisine, made 
            from saltrice and native fruits.
