            <p>
                Originally from Vvardenfell, this recipe traveled with Dunmer 
                fleeing Morrowind after Red Mountain's eruption and has 
                been well received throughout much of Tamriel, albeit with 
                various regional tweaks to the ingredient list. The lightly 
                seasoned filling and crisp crust can satisfy even the pickiest 
                palate.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pie Crust</li>
                <li>Guar Milk</li>
                <li>4 kwama eggs per 1 cup of guar milk</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make pie dough ahead of time, and keep in a cool place
                for atleast 2 hours before rolling out.</li>
                <li>Roll it out, then fit into your 9-inch pie dish. Crimp 
                or flute the edges.</li>
                <li>Keep the shaped pie crust in a cool place for at least 30 minutes. 
                This prevents shrinking. Remember that pie dough must be cold.</li>
                <li>Fill with pie weights. As the pie dough bakes, its fat 
                will melt. The melting fat causes the pie crust to shrink 
                down the sides of the pie dish. To prevent the pie dough 
                from completely losing its shape, weigh it down with pie 
                weights. Carefully line the pie dough with parchment paper 
                first, then pour in pie weights.</li>
                <li>Bake until the edges are lightly brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove pie weights, then prick the crust with a fork.</li>
                <li>Bake crust for about 8 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Fill with quiche filling, then bake the quiche.</li>
            </ol>
