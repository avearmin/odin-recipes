                A meat pie of Redoran origin.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thought to have originated in the city of Ald'ruhn, this
                meat pie is a reflection of the city. It's Ingredients
                are sourced from what would commonly be found in the Ashlands.
                Vegetables are ill-equiped to grow in the volcanic ash, and 
                so the Dunmer who live there would have to rely on meats
                primarly. <strong>It is advised that outlanders be 
                conservative when using ash salts as it has been known to
                cause upset stomach.</strong>
