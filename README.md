# odin-recipes
This basic website about Dunmer Cuisine from the Elder Scrolls series was created for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">The Odin Project's Recipes Project</a>. Students were asked to design a website with a main index page with links to a few recipes.

Prior to creating this website, the course has went over HTML basics like: inserting images, hyperlinks, creating paragaph elements, and creating lists. I have only tried to use what the course has taught thus far.
